# MAPGD: Multi-Agent Prompt Gradient Descent for Collaborative Prompt Optimization

---

## Abstract

Prompt design plays a critical role in the performance of large language models (LLMs), yet existing methods for prompt optimization often rely on single-agent heuristics or isolated editing strategies. These methods lack diversity, collaboration, and robustness in their exploration processes. In this work, we propose **MAPGD**, a novel framework that integrates multi-agent collaboration with gradient-like prompt optimization to systematically and efficiently improve natural language prompts. Each agent explores the prompt space from a different perspective using LLM-generated textual “gradients,” and collaboratively edits the prompt through a combination of beam search, semantic fusion, and bandit-based selection. MAPGD improves diversity, semantic directionality, and interpretability, enabling more effective and scalable prompt engineering.

## 1. Motivation

### 1.1 Importance of Prompt Optimization

LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude rely heavily on prompts to shape their task behavior, tone, and output accuracy. However, crafting effective prompts remains a manual, trial-and-error process that demands substantial expertise and effort.

### 1.2 Limitations of Single-Agent PGD Methods

Existing gradient descent-inspired prompt optimizers (e.g., ProTeGi) suffer from:

* Unidirectional search prone to local optima.
* Instability in gradient semantics across iterations.
* Lack of collaborative signal aggregation.
* Low exploration efficiency due to redundant candidate evaluations.

### 1.3 Objective

We aim to develop a **multi-agent, collaborative optimization framework** that addresses these issues by combining parallel exploration, gradient fusion, and best-arm identification.

## 2. Core Idea

MAPGD rethinks textual prompt optimization as a **collaborative gradient descent** process in the space of natural language. The key idea is to allow multiple autonomous agents to independently critique and improve prompts based on LLM-generated feedback, and then coordinate their improvements via beam search and bandit selection.

| Component         | Role                                                            |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple Agents   | Explore distinct semantic directions for prompt updates         |
| Textual Gradients | Serve as semantic feedback akin to numerical gradients          |
| Gradient Fusion   | Align and integrate semantic directions                         |
| Beam Search       | Expand the prompt space efficiently                             |
| Bandit Selection  | Identify the most promising prompt with minimal evaluation cost |

## 3. System Architecture

The MAPGD framework is structured as follows:

1. **PromptAgents**: Independent agents holding their own version of the prompt and a specific optimization focus (e.g., instruction, formatting, style).
2. **GradientCoordinator**: Aggregates and clusters natural language gradients to detect conflicts and merge prompt edits.
3. **Prompt Expansion**: Generates diverse candidates via gradient-based edits and Monte Carlo (MC) paraphrasing.
4. **PromptSelector**: Efficiently selects top-performing prompts using Successive Rejects or UCB-based bandit algorithms.

## 4. Workflow Overview

### Step-by-Step Process

```
Input: Initial prompt p0, training set D_train, dev set D_dev
Initialize: N agents with initial prompt p0

For each iteration r = 1 to R:
    - Each agent:
        • Samples a mini-batch
        • Uses LLM to generate natural language gradient g
        • Applies g to edit prompt and obtain p'

    - GradientCoordinator:
        • Clusters and fuses gradients
        • Generates candidate prompts via beam expansion + MC paraphrasing

    - PromptSelector:
        • Evaluates prompt candidates on D_dev (subsampled)
        • Selects top-k prompts using a bandit strategy

    - Agents synchronize (or not) based on the selected top prompt

Return: Best prompt from final beam
```

## 5. Module Details

### 5.1 PromptAgent

* Maintains its own prompt version.
* Executes one PGD-style update per iteration via LLM feedback.
* Tracks past gradients and updated prompts for interpretability.

### 5.2 GradientCoordinator

* Embeds and clusters gradients using sentence embeddings.
* Detects and resolves directional conflicts.
* Performs prompt fusion using an LLM (e.g., "Merge these two prompts...").

### 5.3 Prompt Expansion

* Uses beam search guided by gradient edits.
* Applies LLM-based paraphrasing to generate local variants.

### 5.4 PromptSelector

* Approximates each prompt's reward (e.g., F1 score) via subsampling.
* Applies Successive Rejects, UCB, or other best-arm identification techniques.
